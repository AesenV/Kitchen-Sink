Kitchen Sink
==========

Kitchen Sink is a miscellaneous collection of utilities for Minecraft Forge.
Can also be used in plain SE environments by omitting a few classes.

There's no documentation as of yet; for an idea of what it can do, look through the sources.

Downloads are on the [releases page](http://github.com/AesenV/Kitchen-Sink/releases).
